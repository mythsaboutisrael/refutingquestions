              <ul>
                <li>Nations engaged in genocide do not go to great lengths to reduce civilian casualties, including placing their own soldiers at hightened risk by employing ground forces instead of relying exclusively on air and sea bombardments.  Additionally, claims that Israel is intentionally targeting civilians in Gaza have been refuted by a plethora of reliable US intelligence sources, notably White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby. Israel’s practices of dropping leaflets in bombing zones, sending text messages to civilians in range of a potential attack, and establishing humanitarian corridors – plus safe zones – is unprecedented in military history. </li>

<li>Regrettably while the death toll in Gaza is high, the Hamas controlled and manipulated Gaza Health Authority has never confirmed what percentage are terrorists. Instead they issue totally unsubstantiated statements that tens of thousands of women and children have been killed. And keeping civilians at gunpoint in targeted areas for use as human shields is standard procedure by Hamas to create despicable world-wide publicity, at the cost of its own citizens' lives.</li>

<li>Since 1950, the Palestinian population in the West Bank and Gaza has exploded from less than 1 million to over 5.5 million, with the UN projecting that it will reach upwards of 12.7 million by 2100 at the current rate of growth. Yet the world calls this genocide!</li></ul></p>

            <p>This is the wrong question. What should be asked is why does Hamas deliberately sacrifice its own people as human shields for sadistic PR purposes? In this particular incident, as confirmed by an <a href="https://videoidf.azureedge.net/e67ae402-79e2-4e8c-a6a5-d32da01ccf80">intercepted Hamas message</a>, Hamas leadership knew within 15 minutes it was a Palestinian rocket that hit the al-Ahli Arab Hospital, so why did they not tell the truth? Because the &ldquo;big lie&rdquo; works to ensnare world leaders and the press, including the <a href="https://honestreporting.com/media-commits-journalistic-crime-in-coverage-of-gaza-hospital-blast/">NY Times and BBC</a>, into taking the bait of the narrative that Israel is responsible for civilian casualties. Beyond falsely blaming Israel, the actual number of casualties at al-Ahli was also <a href="https://katv.com/news/nation-world/maximum-of-50-killed-in-gaza-hospital-bombing-european-intelligence-report-says-palestine-israel-war-fighting-war-hamas#">gross inflated</a> by Hamas. Now Hamas lies again denying it uses the al-Shifra hospital for military purposes. The IDF has found concrete evidence to the contrary, and the US National Security Council verifies Hamas&rsquo;s demonic <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_8D7cHxTiMSH4K_1J9odcS1CcS7MHTg/view?usp=sharing">use of patients and medical staff as human shields</a> by stating &ldquo;We have our own intelligence that convinces us that Hamas was using al-Shifra as a command and control node and most likely as well as a storage facility.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>What is desperately needed is for the world to remember WHY Israel is in this war. Israel is fighting a vicious, bloodthirsty, devious terrorist organization. <i>Anyone who is really concerned about humanitarianism should first insist that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad immediately release <u>ALL</u> hostages.</i> As to ceasefires, Hamas has broken every single past ceasefire, a total of 12 since Hamas took power in Gaza. And now, the 13th – and most recent – ceasefire has been broken as well by Hamas (by reneging on the hostage deal). During the 2014 Gaza war, Hamas used these ceasefires to attack, murder and kidnap Israelis and launch barrages of missiles at Israel. Hamas will no doubt do so again if a ceasefire is concretized before Israel accomplishes the necessary objective of completely removing Hamas from Gaza.</p>

               <p>This insinuation is a callous minimization of the horrific crimes committed against innocent Israeli women and girls.  First of all, rape is a war crime (UN Resolution 1820). Secondly, the savagery of Hamas on October 7 was within the context of a terrorist attack, there was no war in progress. And to put Hamas’ actions in perspective, once Israel declared war, there still has not been a single reported incident of an Israeli soldier violating a Palestinian woman. Thirdly, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-LKZ6ccNjmdxNC5p8ojRi_PtVdGVWaLs/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=111960823718391951228&rtpof=true&sd=true">silence is violence</a>! The <strong><i>appalling lack of strong, clear and IMMEDIATE condemnation</i></strong> by the world community, the majority of global media, and women’s rights organizations – UN Women in particular – is deplorable.  If this was any other ethnic group of women subjected to pelvises broken by gang rape, unborn fetuses being cut out of wombs, breasts being severed, and other equally heinous crimes, the world’s outrage would be deafening.  Instead, we heard apologetic backpedaling like “the BBC has not been able to independently verify this account.”  Well the evidence is in, and it is conclusive and horrific. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oq577R4emuuSqMkE1AYpSjB5SAYzAT6C/view">Any woman or man who values women’s rights</a> should unapologetically stand on the side of truth and justice, not buy into a narrative that sexual violence needs to be viewed “in context.”</p>

            <p>Regarding civilian casualties, it's noteworthy this accusation is never made against Israel&rsquo;s enemies, who actually seek to maximize the number of dead noncombatants. To the contrary, the<a href="https://www.prageru.com/video/israel-the-worlds-most-moral-army"> IDF does more to minimize civilian casualties than any army in history.</a> As to the supposed 20,000+ Palestinian casualties Gaza&rsquo;s Ministry of Health (run and manipulated by Hamas) claims so far, it <u>makes no distinction between civilians and terrorists</u>. A basic rule of journalism is to have two independent verified sources before running a story, yet the world&rsquo;s media willingly promotes Hamas&rsquo;s one-sided statistics. In all probability the 20,000+ number is grossly misleading. A <a href="https://idsf.org.il/en/">respected Israeli security organization</a>, with reliable IDF connections, reported approximately 20,000 Hamas terrorists have been killed so far. Whatever may be the actual figure, it could quite well be 90% or more terrorists. So does one want to believe the statistics released by baby killing fanatics, or a reputable non-profit with direct IDF connection at the highest levels? Hamas hides the truth because it reveals the tremendous beating their terrorists are taking.</p>

              <p>Hamas grew out of the Muslim Brotherhood, a radical Islamist movement that was founded in Egypt in 1928 by a hardline preacher named Hasan al-Banna. al-Banna was implacably opposed to the creation of a Jewish state, long before there was any so-called occupation. Most despicably, the evil rage of Hamas is the intended outcome of the indoctrination of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axe_NcIEfsU">generations of children being &ldquo;educated&rdquo; to hate Jews and Israel.</a>&nbsp;In addition, Hamas is a proxy of Iran. By funding and training Hamas terrorists, Iran had the ability to dictate the timing of this massacre in support of Iranian strategic objectives. These Iranian objectives include derailing the pending Israel/Saudi peace agreement, creating a world-wide anti-Semitic backlash against Jews and Israel, and diverting Israeli assets towards an all-consuming war while Iran nears completion of a nuclear weapon. Hamas is not attempting liberation for their people. Rather, they are launching a genocidal campaign against Israel at Iran&rsquo;s behest, and letting their own people pay the price.</p>

               <p>Be it a Palestinian or Jew, the loss of one’s home is a traumatic and painful event.  However, this analogy rests on the assumption that Israel is the Palestinians’ “house” in the  first place, and that Palestinian Arabs were evicted from their homes in a violent manner.  In reality, the Muslim population of the land didn’t arrive until the 7th century CE at the earliest, and never even identified as “Palestinian”<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMO4Y_hlXOU">until the name was adopted by Yasser Arafat&rsquo;s terror group the PLO </a>in the late 1950&rsquo;s. Conversely, there has been a constant Jewish presence in the land for over <strong>three thousand years</strong>, despite Babylonian and Roman attempts to ethnically cleanse the land of Jews.  In fact, the name “Palestine,” comes from a Roman attempt to erase the Jewish connection to the land, naming it after their historic enemy, the Philistines, to spite them.  Hence the consistent violence over the millennia has been against Jews, from the conquerors of the past until the “Palestinian” terrorists of today.</p>

            <p>Israel is the opposite of an &ldquo;apartheid&rdquo; state. It is a multicultural democracy and the &ldquo;only free country&rdquo; in the Middle East according to the human rights organization Freedom House. Palestinians are not citizens of Israel and the vast majority do not want to be. They are governed by their own leaders Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. However, Israel has over two million <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cyn-GxsuKLy/%20%E2%80%93">Arab Israeli citizens</a> &ndash; approximately 20% of Israel&rsquo;s population &ndash; including supreme court judges, lawyers, doctors, and Knesset (Parliament) members. In addition, people of color, including Ethiopian Jews and converts like rapper <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXqnYbuaRfVF9ydnlWYOyKuhvxzVrdQ6/view?usp=sharing">Nissim Black </a>and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reel/1072874220371106">NBA star Amar&rsquo;e Stoudemire</a>, serve in the army, are religious leaders, and successful entrepreneurs.

            <p>Hamas is a terrorist organization as designated by numerous countries including the US, Canada, Britain and the EU member states. Hamas&rsquo; Charter is filled with rabid antisemitism andparanoid ranting about Jews, calling for Muslims to wipe them out. In short, Hamas is a fundamentalist religious organization that glorifies death, and does not play by the &ldquo;western&rdquo; playbook of morals, condoning the <a href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/the-hamas-terrorist-organization/the-status-of-women-in-gaza/">abuse and oppression of women</a> and the torture and murder of members of the LGBTQ+ community.

           <p>Though there is a &ldquo;settlement&rdquo; controversy, numerous experts concur that settlements are legal as Israel has historic, security, and legal claims to Judea &amp; Samaria (the West Bank). Nonetheless, the myth of settlements destroying the peace process is a calculated fabrication by Palestinians and their international supporters. Arab anti-Jew violence dates back to the 1920&rsquo;s, when there was no Israel and no settlements. Additionally, from 1948 until 1967, when the Arabs once again went to war to annihilate the Jewish nation, settlements did not exist in Judea &amp; Samaria as this area was fully controlled by Jordan. Clearly, settlements were not the issue then and are a &ldquo;smoke screen&rdquo; now. The&nbsp;real issue, and violation of international law, is the Palestinian&rsquo;s goal to end Israel&rsquo;s existence. This is the actual meaning of the &ldquo;River to the Sea&rdquo; chant, which is naively adopted by US student protestors, including these at a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SwcnVXj7EMp6r4iUs6qkxV3KsgB9oe5J/view">San Francisco public high school</a>. Finally, Israeli settlements <strong>make up only about 3.1% of the territory in the West Bank</strong>, while Jews not allowed to live in the remaining 97%. In short, this issue has been vastly overblown by international media and Palestinian enablers to justify barbaric terrorism.</p>

            <p>This is simply not true. Over the past 75 years, Israel repeatedly offered far-reaching compromises to <a href="https://www.prageru.com/video/why-isnt-there-a-palestinian-state">accept a two-state solution</a>, but Palestinian and Arab leaders consistently rejected every attempt. Upon the British leaving &ldquo;Palestine&rdquo; in 1948, the United Nations had proposed separate Israeli and Arab states. The Arabs chose war rather than co-existence with Israelis, the indigenous people of the land. In 1986, Ehud Barak offered Palestinians an independent state on 97% of the land they demanded, including the Negev, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem, a heroic offer that was celebrated by the international community. It was rejected by Yasser Arafat, who President Clinton attributed with causing his administration&rsquo;s failure in the Middle East. In addition, Ehud Olmert made a similar offer in 2008, which was also rejected. As to the present, as evidenced by the barbaric acts of Hamas, the creation of a Palestinian state next to Israel would be suicidal for the Jews. It will take Palestinians ending <a href="https://idsf.org.il/en/papers/terrorists-in-the-civil-service/">lifelong payments to Jew killers</a> (or their surviving families), the <a href="https://twitter.com/FleurHassanN/status/1717037656125714644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1717037656125714644%7Ctwgr%5E05852598fa9eec19adf8dfd9ea6060e8a929b8ca%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jns.org%2Fun-chief-tries-to-walk-back-remarks-justifying-hamas-massacre%2F"><strong>education of their youth to despise Jews</strong></a><strong>, </strong>and terrorist acts by their people for a Palestinian state to be even considered by Israel.</p>

            <p>Hamas does indeed reflect the overwhelming majority of Palestinian Arabs and their <a href="https://www.jns.org/three-in-four-palestinians-support-hamass-massacre/">genocidal aspirations</a>. In fact, Hamas terror attacks on Israelis <em>increase </em>Palestinian support for Hamas. For example, Palestinian support for Hamas increased dramatically after Hamas launched 4,500 rockets at Israel in May 2021. In addition, Gazan civilians actively participated in, aided, abetted, and <a href="https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001dO8aaGTnwi24j_75yfG3G3QgAetwFQ3dh5-NQqTfVWqoJMYmmVe2Klg80t8m_RT2gIa1nxdMoeIzzE_PZo3ngj_PcM7zWsAtGEun_5VreNGeEq1QDodQ4daC9Sj8wNCxLceodiVvMQzK2aTeRbgYRbqHaJoYA98af03E3SMuQJa9V-ioK-T0KPTU3R-oZNy_&amp;c=P4IbvjO_fT1aa0nVhbIbuaetQ9TJ6mmrePmhYnL8kxk1lke9D-bGiQ==&amp;ch=L5l9yGPWhRKBXHuVYPtRDdzhTBJ8-LxLSeJ8-L-ZE95O-ILf_PxCKg=="><strong>celebrated</strong></a> the Oct. 7 massacre, and it was &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Gazan civilian workers, among the 20,000 that Israel allowed in daily, who <a href="https://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001dO8aaGTnwi24j_75yfG3G3QgAetwFQ3dh5-NQqTfVWqoJMYmmVe2Klg80t8m_RT24mlkVanDlORn0oiQk9tp2mSnCYQid8Su9Qgt-rlmBwsd93WZmRV-IDQQN-83jNHnGZrNWTeO70sviltwQ0_0cDEuD9T1XHXoiNjWGKuwnQGSJdTqAID73J1oYns2CkbTCd51P2XYpVprrF9r8IAHSelrFfEb0bO6&amp;c=P4IbvjO_fT1aa0nVhbIbuaetQ9TJ6mmrePmhYnL8kxk1lke9D-bGiQ==&amp;ch=L5l9yGPWhRKBXHuVYPtRDdzhTBJ8-LxLSeJ8-L-ZE95O-ILf_PxCKg=="><strong>collected detailed intelligence</strong></a> on homes and citizens in southern Israeli towns and drew maps for the terrorists to use. Furthermore, a June 2023 CPCSR poll revealed that 79% of Gazans and 71% of all Palestinian Arabs favored forming even more armed anti-Israel terror groups, making it clear that the majority of Palestinians have been radicalized to seek the destruction of Israel and the murder of Jews. Clearly the indoctrination of children has had its desired effect for Hamas, and though there certainly may be exceptions, this support of terrorist regimes by Palestinians is the current unfortunate reality.</p>

            <p>Unbeknownst to many, Egypt ALSO has a border with Gaza and keeps it closed due to extensive security concerns. In fact, Israel&rsquo;s blockade has been actually looser than Egypt&rsquo;s in many respects, allowing Gazans to enter Israel proper for medical treatment and work. In addition, despite over blown accountsof Gaza&rsquo;s population density, the territory has comparable density to Sydney, Australia, and London, U.K., is 800 people per square mile less densely populated than Tokyo, Japan, and is over three times less densely populated than Jakarta, Indonesia. The inquisitive student might also ask, does an &ldquo;open air prison&rdquo; have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.962788860472124&amp;type=3">luxury homes for its leaders</a>, beautiful beaches, and plentiful markets? The answer is that, as seen clearly in Hamas intentionally using its citizens as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IWrLkTYRO0">human shields</a> and inflating casualty numbers, propaganda &ndash; not truth &ndash; is the objective of the Hamas PR machine.</p>

<li>Do you know Hamas and the Palestinians <a href="https://aish.com/why-are-womens-groups-backing-hamas/?src=ac">abuse women </a>and LGBTQ+ people? If so, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oq577R4emuuSqMkE1AYpSjB5SAYzAT6C/view">why do you still support </a>Hamas?</li>
<li>Since Egypt borders Gaza, why will Egypt not let in the Palestinians to help prevent a &ldquo;humanitarian crisis?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Am I correct that you believe the Jews ethnically cleansed Arabs out of Israel in 1948 on the &ldquo;Nakba Day?&rdquo; If so, how is it that the Israeli Declaration of Independence invited Arabs to stay, which 150,000 did and received full Israeli citizenship?</li>
<li>Hamas knows Israel will attack forcefully in response to <a href="https://aish.com/5-big-lies-about-israels-war-with-gaza/?src=ac">Hamas&rsquo;s actions</a>. <strong><em>So why are there no bomb </em></strong><strong><em>shelters in Gaza?</em></strong> Is it possible Hamas has used huge amounts of concrete and materials it compiles by stealing international aid to build tunnels for its terror network instead of supporting its <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i_8D7cHxTiMSH4K_1J9odcS1CcS7MHTg/view?usp=sharing">civilian population</a>?</li>
<li>What does the term &ldquo;human shields&rdquo; mean? Do you think the people of Gaza who become human shields do so willingly, knowing they may be killed or severely injured?</li>
<li>The Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) was founded by Yasser Arafat in 1964. What exactly were they trying to liberate? In 1964 Jordan had full control of the West Bank and East Jerusalem &ndash; including the entire Temple Mount &ndash; and Egypt controlled Gaza, so isn&rsquo;t the correct answer that the objective of the PLO from its inception was to &ldquo;liberate&rdquo; the entire land of Israel from the Jews?</li>
